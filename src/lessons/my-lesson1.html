            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                This course is an introduction to the basic skills anybody
                learning JavaScript must know. It was created by
                Jennifer Bland for Women Who Code Atlanta.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course will cover the basics of higher-order functions
                in JavaScript. A higher-order function is a <i>function that
                accepts another function as an argument, or returns a
                function as its result.</i> Both of these requirements rely
                on functions being first-class objects in a language.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course was created because I am teaching an <b>Advanced
            JavaScript Course</b> for Women Who Code. Several people asked if
                they are new to JavaScript programming, would they be able to
                attend my class. If you can understand the topics in this
                course then you have enough programming skills to attend my
                <b>Advanced JavaScript Course</b>.  You can find <a
